# Simple Implicit and Explicit Intent Application
- This is a simple Android application that demonstrates the use of both explicit and implicit intents. 
- The app consists of two activities: MainActivity and DashboardActivity. 
- The MainActivity contains buttons that trigger explicit and implicit intents to start the SecondActivity or open a web page, respectively.


## Features
- Explicit Intent: The app uses an Login form style explicit intent, that requires the user to insert the default email and password to start the DashboardActivity when the user clicks the "Login" button.
- `Email: admin@email.com` 
- `Password: admin123`
- Implicit Intent: The app uses an implicit intent to open a youtube app, (if doesn't have the app opens the web) when the user clicks the "Click Me!" button.
